<p>2025 was a strong year for office and industrial leasing activity in Phoenix. In particular, robust leasing in the office sector pushed annual net absorption to its highest level since 2019, reaching a total of 414,850 square feet for the year, according to Colliers research. </p>
<p>Industrial leasing activity also rebounded in 2025, closing the year with 18.2 million square feet of net absorption.</p>
<p>In the office market, the largest deals were concentrated in the second half of the year, primarily in the Scottsdale Airpark / Desert Ridge area, Tempe, Chandler, and Midtown. The two largest office leases of the year were both in Scottsdale Airpark. The largest was a 152,162-square-foot sublease at North Scottsdale Corporate Center II, followed by Sprouts Farmers Market’s headquarters lease at Desert Ridge totaling 144,500 square feet.</p>

<p>Industrial leasing activity was heavily concentrated in Southwest Phoenix, particularly in Glendale, Goodyear, and Buckeye. Similar to the office market, the largest industrial deals were signed in the second half of the year, with four of the top five transactions occurring in July. The largest industrial lease of the year was a 1.2 million-square-foot deal at 99th Avenue and Buckeye Road, followed by a 1.1 million-square-foot lease at 99th Avenue and Lower Buckeye Road.</p>
<p>The largest industrial deal of 2025 was a 1.3-million-square-foot sublease at Elwood Logistics Center in Goodyear, with CEVA Logistics taking occupancy. This was followed by Walmart’s 1.27-million-square-foot lease at 7733 N. Litchfield Road in Glendale for its Luke Field building. In November, Walmart acquired the property for $152.2 million, marking the first tenant commitment at Luke Field.</p>
